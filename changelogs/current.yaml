bug_fixes:
- area: http
  change: |
    fixed a bug with internal redirects not being performed for drained connections.
- area: jwt_authn

    fixed a bug where a negative "exp", "iat", or "nbf" integer in JWT token readed as a large positive value.
- area: grpc_transcoder
  change: |
    fixed a bug where a request with a wrong binding type is not rejected if the request body is empty.
- area: listener
  change: |
    fixed a bug that doesn't handle of an update for a listener with IPv4-mapped address correctly, and that will lead to a memory leak.
- area: transport_socket
  change: |
    fixed a bug that prevented the tcp stats to be retrieved when running on kernels different than the kernel where Envoy was built.
- area: logger
  change: |
    added the %j and %_ format support for fine-grain loggers to make it consistant with default loggers.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    fixed the routing decision when thrift filters change the value of the cluster header.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed edge-case interaction between weighted clusters, cluster headers and (request|response)_headers_to_(add|remove).
- area: upstream
  change: |
    fixed a bug where custom transport socket hashes might not be respected by wrapper passthrough sockets. This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.fix_hash_key`` to false.
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: grpc_json_transcoder
  change: |
    fix a bug when using http2, request body has google.api.HttpBody and the size is < 16KB, it will cause EOF from the backend grpc server.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed a bug that incorrectly rewrote the path when using ``regex_rewrite`` for redirects matched on prefix.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    fixed a bug when passthrough header was matched, envoy would always remove the authorization header. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_header_passthrough_fix`` to false.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    fixed a bug that encoder filters and decoder filters of generic proxy will be executed in the same order. The encoder filters' execuate order should be the reverse of decoder filters' in the generic proxy.
- area: quic
  change: |
    reject configs that specify require_client_certificate with QUIC since clients certificates are currently unsupported in QUIC. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.reject_require_client_certificate_with_quic`` to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    fixed a bug where Utility::PercentEncoding::encode() encodes some characters incorrectly because it was treating the value as negative.
- area: validation
  change: |
    fixed a crash which could happen when optional ``engine_type`` is not provided in regex.
