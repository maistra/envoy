    Close HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections that prematurely reset streams. The runtime key
    ``overload.premature_reset_min_stream_lifetime_seconds`` determines the interval where received stream
    reset is considered premature (with 1 second default). The runtime key ``overload.premature_reset_total_stream_count``,
    with the default value of 500, determines the number of requests received from a connection before the check for premature
    resets is applied. The connection is disconnected if more than 50% of resets are premature.
    Setting the runtime key ``envoy.restart_features.send_goaway_for_premature_rst_streams`` to ``false`` completely disables
    this check.
